samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

# Flutter CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
This repository contains a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for Flutter applications using GitHub Actions. The pipeline automates code analysis, testing, and builds for Android platforms.

## Workflow Features

### Automated Triggers
The pipeline automatically runs on:
- Every push to the `main` branch
- Every pull request to the `main` branch
- Manual trigger via GitHub Actions UI

### CI/CD Pipeline Steps

#### Code Analysis and Testing
- Runs on Ubuntu 22.04
- Checks out the repository code
- Sets up Flutter 3.27.4 (supporting Dart 3.6.1)
- Verifies Dart version
- Installs dependencies with `flutter pub get`
- Performs static code analysis with `flutter analyze`

#### Android Build Pipeline
- Runs after successful code analysis
- Sets up Flutter 3.27.4
- Configures Java 17 using Temurin distribution
- Builds Android App Bundle (AAB) for release
- Implements security best practices by removing signing files after build

## Benefits

- **Quality Assurance**: Automatically checks code quality and prevents integration of problematic code
- **Time Efficiency**: Eliminates manual build processes
- **Consistency**: Ensures builds are performed in a consistent environment
- **Early Issue Detection**: Identifies problems early in the development cycle
- **Streamlined Releases**: Simplifies the release process for Android

## Technical Requirements

- Flutter 3.27.4
- Dart 3.6.1
- Java 17 (Temurin distribution)
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled

## Future Enhancements

- iOS build pipeline integration
- Automated testing with coverage reports
- Deployment to app stores
- Version management
- Slack/Teams notifications
- Code quality metrics reporting
